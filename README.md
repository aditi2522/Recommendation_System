# Recommendation_System
There are two types of recommendation systems. They are
Content-Based Recommender System
Collaborative Recommender System

Content-Based Recommender System
A content-based recommender system works on the data generated from a user. The data can be generated either explicitly (like clicking likes) or implicitly (like clicking on links). This data will be used to create a user profile for the user which contain the metadata of the items user interacted. More the data it receives more accurate the system or engine becomes.


Collaborative Recommender System
A collaborative recommender system makes a recommendation based on how similar users liked the item. The system will group users with similar tastes. In addition to user similarity, recommender systems can also perform collaborative filtering using item similarity (like ‘Users who liked this item X also liked Y’).


Here I have implemented a content based recommendation system and the other one is yet to come
